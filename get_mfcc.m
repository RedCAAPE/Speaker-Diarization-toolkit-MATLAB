function MFCC = get_mfcc (sig,fs,win_len,win_overlap,win_shape)
% This function is the feature extraction step in the speaker diarization task. For the Speech-Activity-Detection and Speaker-Clustering derivatives of MFCCs are used, whereas for the Speaker-Segmentation only the MFCC coefficients with the Short time energy are used.
